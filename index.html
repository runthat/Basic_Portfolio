      <p>Welcome to my page! This is where improvements take place, and it's mine and yours! 
        I'm Moe Davis perhaps you need an embrace, I'm here to assure you that 
        of difficulty and hardship there is ease and comfort in life once again. This place is dedicated
        to you, by accounting for the most valuable asset we posses, and that is ourselves.</p>
        <p>Go placcidly amid the noise and the haste, and remember what peace there may be in silence. As
        far as possible, without surrender, be on good terms with all persons.</p>
        <p>Enjoy your achievements as well as your plans. Keep interested in your own career, however
        humble; it is a real possession in the changing fortunes of time.</p>
        <p>Be yourself. Especially do not feign affection. Neither be cynical about love; for in the face
        of all aridity and disenchantment, it is as perennial as the grass.</p>                       
        <p>Beyond a wholesome discipline, be gentle with yourself. You are a child of the universe no less
        than the trees and the stars; you have a right to be here.</p>
        <p>And whether or not it is clear to you, no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should.
        Therefore be at peace with God, whatever you conceive Him to be. And whatever your labors and
        aspirations, in the noisy confusion of life, keep peace in your soul. With all its sham,
        drudgery and broken dreams, it is still a beautiful world. Be cheerful. Strive to be happy.</p>
